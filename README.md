SkyMarket 
=======
I'm gonna create a e-commerce mobile application, something like McDo app or FoodPanda. In this app, users can choose what item to order and pay and then that transaction saves into the database using SQL. In the mobile app, I'm gonna use React Native as front-end and PHP as back-end. This app is for the clients.

Second, I'm gonna create a website management tool for admins. It is used to add, display, update, and delete information about products. I'm planning to use html or php file for this as front-end. And I'm gonna use java as it's back-end. Still, I'm gonna use SQL queries to communicate with the database.
